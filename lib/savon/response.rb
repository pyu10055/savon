module Savon

  # = Savon::Response
  #
  # Savon::Response represents both HTTP and SOAP response.
  #
  # == SOAP fault
  #
  # Assuming the default behavior of raising errors is disabled, you can ask the response object
  # if there was a SOAP fault or an HTTP error and get the SOAP fault or HTTP error message.
  #
  #   response.soap_fault?
  #   # => true
  #
  #   response.soap_fault
  #   # => "(soap:Server) Fault occurred while processing."
  #
  #   response.http_error?
  #   # => true
  #
  #   response.http_error
  #   # => "Not found (404)"
  #
  # == Response as XML
  #
  # To get the raw SOAP response XML, you can call to_xml or to_s on the response object.
  #
  #   response.to_xml
  #   => "<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  #   => "..."
  #   => "</soap:Envelope>"
  #
  # == Response as a Hash
  #
  # You can also let Savon translate the SOAP response body to a Hash.
  #
  #   response.to_hash
  #   => { :findUserByIdResponse => {
  #   =>   :id => "123",
  #   =>   :username => "eve"
  #   =>   :active => true
  #   => }
  #
  # When translating the SOAP response to a Hash, some XML tags and values are converted to more
  # convenient Ruby objects. Translation is done through John Nunemaker's {Crack}[http://github.com/jnunemaker/crack]
  # library along with some custom mapping.
  #
  # * XML tags (Hash keys) are converted to snake_case Symbols and namespaces are stripped off
  # * SOAP xs:nil values are converted to nil objects
  # * XML values specified in xs:DateTime format are converted to DateTime objects
  # * XML values of "true" and "false" are converted to TrueClass and FalseClass
  #
  # == Net::HTTP response
  #
  # If for some reason you need to access the Net::HTTP response object ... you can.
  #
  #   bc. response.http
  #   => #<Net::HTTPOK:0x7f749a1aa4a8>
